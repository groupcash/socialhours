## Problem

* A lot of volunteering work being done without receiving certification
* Certificates are costly and difficult to come by
* Evaluating certificates is difficult due to a lack of standardization

## Solution

Make it easy for CSOs for certify the work done by volunteers based on hours as a common standard

* CSOs issue coins for each type of voluntary work
* Volunteers receive one coin for each hour worked
* Volunteers can prove ownership of coins when required

Each coin contains
* The public key of the CSO
* The public key of the volunteer
* A description of the work done
* A value representing the number of hours worked

## Actors

* Regulator authorizing CSOs to issue of coins
* CSOs offering volunteering work
* Volunteers

## Implemenation

Issuing, transferring and proving ownership of coins is supported by digital signatures
Each actor is identified by a public/private key pair used for signatures
